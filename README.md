## Flappy Bird ML Agent (Under Development)

## Project Overview

Auto Flappy is a project created using Unity, showcasing a clone of the popular game Flappy Bird. What makes this project unique is the integration of a Machine Learning (ML) agent to control the bird. The ML agent is currently under development, with ongoing efforts to train and optimize its performance. The goal is to demonstrate the potential of reinforcement learning in gaming scenarios.

## Features

1. **Flappy Bird Clone:**
   - Experience the classic Flappy Bird gameplay with a Unity twist.

2. **ML Agent Control (Under Development):**
   - The bird will be controlled by a trained ML agent, demonstrating the capabilities of reinforcement learning. Please note that the ML agent is still under development.

3. **Training Environment:**
   - Train and observe the ML agent in a controlled environment with adjustable parameters.

4. **Score Tracking:**
   - Keep track of the ML agent's performance with a scoring system.

## Technologies Used

- **Unity:** A powerful game development engine for creating 2D and 3D games.

- **ML-Agents Toolkit:** Unity's Machine Learning Agents Toolkit, allowing developers to integrate machine learning algorithms into Unity projects.

## How to Run the Game

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/auto_flappy.git
   ```

2. **Open the Project in Unity:**
   - Open Unity Hub and add the project by selecting the project folder.

3. **Explore the Scenes:**
   - Navigate to the "Scenes" folder in Unity to explore and run the Flappy Bird ML Agent scene.

4. **Adjust Parameters (Optional):**
   - Modify training parameters or environment settings as needed.

5. **Run the Game:**
   - Press the "Play" button in Unity to run the Flappy Bird ML Agent game.
